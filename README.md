## Integration of a model for a web agency

The first project of my web developer training was to integrate a model for a web agency, the *WebAgency*.

For making this project, I had to use only **HTML5/CSS3**, CSS preprocessors, frameworks, JavaScript or any programming language were not allowed.

Here are the skills I developed during this project:

* **Coding the structure of a web page in HTML**
1. HTML page passes W3C HTML validation without error
2. HTML tags are defined with relevant HTML 5 semantics
3. Icons are created with a relevant tool: Font Awesome
*  **Coding the presentation of a web page in CSS**
1. CSS code passes W3C CSS validation
2. The CSS code is written in an external CSS file
3. No CSS code is applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag
* **Manage responsiveness with Media Queries**
1. The viewport is configured in the header of the HTML page
2. Two relevant breakpoints are defined
3. Media queries are used# projet1-openclassrooms-dwj
